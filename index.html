        <h2>  Famous Animators Info </h2>
        <i>The director, producer, 
            animator, and storyteller Hayao Miyazaki was the leader of one of the most successful animated motion picture studios in the world,
             Studio Ghibli. The studio arose out of his success with the motion picture Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind , and its continued 
             success was wholly dependent on the motion pictures that he wrote and directed. In the 1990s he created the most successful films 
             in the history of Japan, setting numerous box-office records. While his films were already popular among anime enthusiasts worldwide,
              a distribution deal with Disney Studios in 1996 brought several of Miyazaki's works to broader audiences; he had established himself
               as an innovator and artist at least equal in stature to Walt Disney himself. As a leader Miyazaki attracted to his productions some
                of Japan's finest writers, artists, directors, and producers, as well as the outstanding composer Joe Hisaishi, whose scores for 
                Miyazaki's films became classics themselves.

        <h3>What is animation?</h3>
        <p>Animation is a method in which figures are manipulated to appear as moving images. In traditional animation, images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film. Today, most animations are made with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation, while 2D computer animation (which may have the look of traditional animation) can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth, or faster real-time renderings. Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two- and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts, puppets, or clay figures.

            An animated cartoon is an animated film, usually a short film, featuring an exaggerated visual style. The style takes inspiration from comic strips, often featuring anthropomorphic animals, superheroes, or the adventures of human protagonists (either who is a child or adult). Especially with animals that form a natural predator/prey relationship (e.g. cats and mice, coyotes and birds) the action often centers around violent pratfalls such as falls, collisions, and explosions that would be lethal in real life.
            
            Commonly, animators achieved the effect by a rapid succession of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusion—as in motion pictures in general—is thought to rely on the phi phenomenon and beta movement, but the exact causes are still uncertain. Analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the phénakisticope, zoetrope, flip book, praxinoscope, and film. Television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally. For display on computers, technology such as the animated GIF and Flash animation were developed.
            
            In addition to short films, feature films, television series, animated GIFs, and other media dedicated to the display of moving images, animation is also prevalent in video games, motion graphics, user interfaces, and visual effects.[1]
            
            The physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics—for instance moving images in magic lantern shows—can also be considered animation. The mechanical manipulation of three-dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in automata. Electronic automata were popularized by Disney as animatronics.</p>
